- 👋 Hi, I’m @SylvainBruyat
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, dev- and not-dev-related
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web development (JS and SQL for now, then JS front-end frameworks and PHP and so on)
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet because I need to learn first and that's already a LOOOOT on my plate
- 📫 How to reach me: coming soon!
