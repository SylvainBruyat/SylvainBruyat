- 👋 Hi, I’m @SylvainBruyat
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, dev- and not-dev-related, from digital sobriety to photography
- 🌱 I’m a freelance web developer, mainly on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). But I am still planning to learn PHP and many other things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of any size, in either a French- or English-speaking work environment. 100% remote.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvain-bruyat/)
