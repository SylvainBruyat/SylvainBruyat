- 👋 Hello, my name is Sylvain Bruyat, I'm a freelance web developer. And [here is my portfolio](https://sylvain-bruyat.dev).
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, dev- and not-dev-related, from digital sobriety to photography.
- 🌱 I work mainly on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Learning Typescript is in progress, PHP, SQL Databases and many other things will come later.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of any size, in either a French- or English-speaking work environment. 100% remote.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sylvain-bruyat/)
